# 1st_project
This is my first project ..
This project is a fully functional college website designed to facilitate the admission process. 
The website includes essential pages such as a home page, an application form page, a payment of fees page,
and two additional relevant pages. The final feature of the website is the generation of a student admit card,
which can be downloaded as a PDF or CSV file after the application form is filled out and the fees are submitted.
